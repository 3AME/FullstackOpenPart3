# Introduction   
This part focuses on advanced backend development concepts such as testing, GraphQL, and server-side rendering. It's essential that each part is launched separately to ensure the proper functionality and separation of concerns between the different backend services.

## Requirements
To complete the exercises in Part 3, you need the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed
- A code editor like VS Code
- Familiarity with REST API and basic backend concepts

## How to Launch Part 3
This section requires separate setup from previous parts. Please follow these steps to launch Part 3:

- Step 1: Clone the repository
First, clone the repository for Part 3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fullstackopen/fullstackopen.git
```
- Step 2: Navigate to the correct folder
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the folder for Part 3:
```
cd fullstackopen/part3
```
- Step 3: Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```
- Step 4: Start the server
Now, start the server for Part 3:
```
npm run dev
```
This will launch the application on http://localhost:3003 (or whatever port is specified).

## Notes
- Ensure that Part 3 is launched separately from previous parts due to its unique backend structure.

- If you encounter any issues while running Part 3, please check the course's official forums or the discussion boards for further troubleshooting.
